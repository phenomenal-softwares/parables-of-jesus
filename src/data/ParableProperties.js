              <p>
              The seeds falling by the roadside represents one who hears the Word without understanding. The devil immediately steals it from such a person.
              It is surprising that the devil has the ability to steal the word of God from a person (since he is originally a thief (John 10:10), but he can only steal it from someone who doesn't understand the Word.
              It is therefore important not only to read or hear the Word of God but also understand it.
              </p>
              <p>
              The seeds falling on stony places represents one who hears and receives the Word joyfully but only understands it at the surface level. The challenges of the world come (as represented by the sun with its scorching heat) but the Word which this person seems to understand does not profit or save him in times of trouble.
              It is therefore important to deeply and contextually understand the Word, and also nurture and develop it in our hearts.
              </p>
              <p>
              The seeds falling among thorns represents one who hears the Word indeed but is swayed away, this time not because of challenges or hard times, but because of the pleasures of this world. It is surprising that both hard times and good times can impede a person's spiritual growth.
              It is therefore important when we receive the word to watch out for thorns - our desires and ambitions - which have the tendency to overload our minds and choke out the Word.
              </p>
              <p>
              The seeds falling on good grounds represents one who, not only receives and understands the Word, but also nurtures it into full growth.
              Since the Word of God is a seed sown into our lives, we must water and nourish it everyday with prayer, meditation, and practice.

            Eventually, the younger son realized the emptiness of life without Christ. No matter the achievements or wealth, anyone without Christ will always be in want. True fulfillment and perfect peace come only from a close relationship with Him.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our true inheritance is in God's kingdom. The younger son realized that his father had everything he was suffering to obtain. What Satan offers to sinners is merely a counterfeit of what rightfully belongs to them in God's kingdom.

            <p>
            However, he made the best decision any sinner can make—true repentance. His state reflects all of humanity. We sinned and lost our sonship, becoming unworthy to be called children of God. But God, in His mercy, forgave us and restored us to His family.

            His father welcomed him back and threw a celebration. The best robe symbolizes the righteousness God gives believers. The ring signifies acceptance and authority, while the shoes represent the restoration of duty. God commissions those who return to Him.

            The older brother represents the religious leaders who resented Jesus for spending time with sinners. Even today, some self-righteous people envy the grace that God lavishes on repentant sinners, believing they deserve more because of their good deeds.

              This parable teaches that no sinner is too far gone for God's grace. Heaven rejoices more over one repentant sinner than over many who never strayed.

              </p>
              <p>
              God called him a fool because he left God out of his plans. True wisdom is living with an eternal perspective, rather than pursuing wealth for personal gain.

              The ten virgins represent all kinds of Christians. Jesus calls those who hear His words and obey them "wise," while those who only listen but fail to act are "foolish."
              </p>
              <p>
              The oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit. Only those who have the Holy Spirit are truly prepared for Christ’s return.

              The bridegroom represents Jesus, who comes unexpectedly. The foolish virgins try to borrow oil,

              </p>

              When Jesus returns, it will be too late for those who only claim to follow Him but lack the Holy Spirit. They will be denied entry into His kingdom.

              The man in the parable represents Christ, who travels to a far country (heaven) but will return. The goods He entrusts to His servants symbolize the spiritual resources given to believers.
              </p>
              <p>
              God gives gifts according to each person's capacity. The Master's approval is based on our faithfulness in handling our resources, not about the quantity we get. 
              We must refrain from envying those with more possessions or talents but instead aim to make maximum profit with our own resources, no matter how small.
              </p>

              The unprofitable servant represents those with misconceptions about God. God calls those who don't obey Him "wicked" and those who don't work for Him "lazy". 
              If someone fails to use their gifts, God takes them away and gives them to the faithful.
              </p>

    The Jews were the original invitees but rejected God's invitation, prioritizing worldly matters instead. The servants delivering the invitation symbolize the prophets who were rejected and, in some cases, killed.

    God will judge those who reject His invitation to eternal life. Since the first invitees refused, He extended the invitation to others—the Gentile nations. Anyone, regardless of background, is welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now people who will enter God's kingdom are required to put on a wedding garment provided by the King. The wedding garment is the righteousness of Christ, which is freely given to anyone who accepts the Lord Jesus into their life.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a man without the wedding garment but he's part of those in the wedding hall. He represents those who are in church and appear to be Christian but are not sincerely born again. Such people are the religious type. 
    Outwardly, they portray righteousness but inwardly, they don't know Christ. Their names are not written in the book of life, and they are cast into the lake of fire for eternal torment (Rev 20:15).

              </p>
              <p>
              Anything we offer to our neighbours is what we give to Christ, and how we treat those around us is how we treat Christ. That's why the Bible says that it is impossible to love God without loving our neighbours, and we can demonstrate our love for our neighbours and our faith in God by sharing what we have with others, especially the poor, the weak, and the needy.

              The seed represents the Word of God. When planted in the right heart, it grows automatically, systematically, and unstoppably.
              </p>
              <p>
              When we preach the gospel, we must trust that the Holy Spirit will do His work. It is not our job to force transformation—God makes the seed grow in His time.

    meaning: `<p>
              Even at the most inconvenient hour, a person will eventually give in to a friend's persistent requests.
              </p>
              <p>
              Unlike the reluctant friend in this parable, God is always willing to give us what we ask. However, He may test our persistence and faith before granting our requests. If answers seem delayed, it is to refine our trust in Him.
              </p>
              <p>
              God only gives good gifts—He will never grant requests that go against His will. This is why we must seek His will through scripture and the Holy Spirit before praying.

    reference: "Luke 13:6-9",

              The owner of the fig tree represents God. The gardener tending to the tree represents Jesus. The barren fig tree represents humanity.
              </p>
              <p>
              For a long time, humanity has failed to produce the fruits of righteousness. God was ready to bring judgment, but Jesus interceded, giving us another chance to bear fruit.
              </p>
              <p>
              Ultimately, those who fail to bear spiritual fruit will face judgment.

  reference: "Luke 16:1-13",
  meaning: `<p>
            The steward (or manager) knew for certain that he would lose his job, yet he did not waste time blaming others. Instead, he acted wisely to secure his future.
            </p>
            <p>
            The master commended the steward—not for his dishonesty, but for his shrewdness in preparing for what was ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
            Jesus teaches us to use our resources wisely by investing in relationships and helping others. 
            The people we assist today may help us in times of trouble in the future, when our money fails.
            </p>
            <p>
            Additionally, Jesus emphasizes the importance of financial integrity. 
            If we are dishonest in handling small resources, we cannot expect God to entrust us with greater blessings.

  reference: "Luke 16:19-31",
  meaning: `<p>
            The rich man represents those who selfishly hoard the resources God has entrusted to them, using them only for personal indulgence while ignoring the needs of others.
            </p>
            <p>
            Lazarus, the poor man, had faith in God and was carried to Abraham’s Bosom (Paradise) after his death. His faith, not his poverty, qualified him for eternal rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            The rich man also died and was cast in hell. Hell is a place of torment where unbelievers are kept after death. Another name for hell is Hades (Greek) or Sheol (Hebrew). 
            Paradise and Hades were separated by a great chasm or void or abyss, but were close enough for those in one place to see into the other, and to hear one another.
            </p>
            <p>
            This parable also refutes the idea of reincarnation. After death, souls are either in Paradise or Hades until the final resurrection and judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
            Furthermore, it highlights the reality of eternal separation. The rich man's prayers in Hades went unanswered because judgment follows death—it was too late for him.

  reference: "Luke 18:1-8",
  meaning: `<p>
            Unlike the unjust judge in this parable, God is a righteous and compassionate judge who willingly grants the requests of His children at the right time—according to His will.
            </p>
            <p>
            If even a corrupt judge yields to persistence, how much more will God respond to those who seek Him diligently?
            </p>
            <p>
            However, God often tests the sincerity of our hearts and the strength of our faith. This is why persistence in prayer is essential.

  reference: "Luke 18:9-14",
  meaning: `<p>
            This parable contrasts two kinds of people in prayer: those who believe they deserve God's approval because of their good deeds, and those who humbly seek His mercy.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Pharisee proudly listed his accomplishments before God, believing he was better than others. This kind of self-righteousness is unacceptable to God.
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, the tax collector humbly admitted his sinfulness and pleaded for God's mercy. He was justified before God, while the Pharisee was not.
            </p>
            <p>
            This parable warns us against spiritual pride. Even if we think we are better than the Pharisee in the story, that very thought reflects the pride Jesus cautioned against.
            </p>
            <p>
            Good works are important, but they do not earn us anything before God. Only His mercy justifies us.
